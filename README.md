# Ultrasonic-distance-sensing-

I'm happy to share my simple project Ultrasonic distance sensing to detect an obstacle coming .

ðŸ”˜idea of project :

system capable of accurately measuring distances . If the distance between the sensor and the obstacle is less than or equel 10 cm, buzzer will give you sound for 10 ms,else if the distance is less than or equel 5 cm, buzzer will give you non-stop sound until the obstacle is farther than 5 cm . If the distance is greater than 80 cm, it will print No opject.

ðŸ”˜ Hardware:

-Ultrasonic sensor
-buzzer
-LCD 2*16
-Variable resistance << To control the lighting intensity
-AVR 
-Atmega32A .

ðŸ”˜ Software:

-Main Application Layer
-HAL Layer (LCD).
-MCAL Layer (DIO, TIMER).
